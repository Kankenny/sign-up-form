# Sign-up-form
Showcasing intermediate HTML and CSS concepts:

  1.) Forms and input types
  
  2.) Form styling
  
  3.) Pseudoclasses
  
The concepts applied in this project will eventually be applied to my personal website as I plan to implement 
an automated emailing system to whoever wants to sign-up
